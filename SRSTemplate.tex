\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose} 
This is the system requirement specification (SRS) aims to refine and expand on the required capabilities of the NavUP system. This includes discussion of the individual low coupled subsystems, functional and quality requirements. This document is intended for the developers of the NavUP system as well as the clients who own the system. It will refine what is required of the system, what the main purpose of the system will be and what additional capabilities it will have. 
\subsection{Scope}
The system being designed will be able to guide a variety of users such as students, lecturers and visitors, through the University of Pretoria's (UP) various campuses. This system will be identified as the NavUP system, referencing the navigation it will provide to visitors of the UP campuses. The system will be able to route users between buildings and on a campus, as well as guiding them to the chosen lecture hall within the building. Push notifications will also be sent to the users through the application when he/she is near a venue where public events are currently or will in future occur. There will not be any push notifications sent if the users is not near the venue where these events will occur. The user will be able to create a profile which will unlock additional functionalities such as sharing locations with friends, saving frequently used places, and adding timetable integration. The application will also be able to notify a user about high traffic areas which the user may want to avoid in order to arrive earlier at his/her destination. The system aims to simplify all users' navigation through the various UP campuses, ensuring quicker navigation to destinations and avoidance of congested routes.     
\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviation}
SRS - System Requirement Specification
UP - University of Pretoria
NavUp - The system being designed, acronym for Navigate(Nav) University of Pretoria (UP).
System - The NavUp system that is being designed.
Product/Application - NavUp system
Traffic - Areas in which there is a higher concentration of users which may affect arrival times.
Hot Spots - Areas in which there are wi-fi access for the users.
\subsection{Overview}
This document will provide more details abut the product (NavUp), including different interfaces, memory requirements, operations, as well as site adapt ion requirements. Functions, characteristics, constraints, and dependencies will be discussed. Lastly the document will elaborate on  the different requirements, including external interface and functional requirements.

			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Use Case Prioritization}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Critical
					\begin{itemize}
						\item User identifies destination
						\item Application determines location
						\item A user must be able to see building names as he passes them
						\item A user must specify  the kind of access
						\item A user must be able to see the campus map without searching for a location
						\item Venues should be grouped into categories
							\begin{itemize}
							\item A user must select a destination from category without typing it out
							\end{itemize}
						\item A user must see all the routes o the venue
							\begin{itemize}
								\item Disabilities
								\item Avoiding pedestrian traffic congestion
							\end{itemize}
						\item The user must be able to see arrival time
					\end{itemize}
				\item important
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The UP admin must be able to update venues
						\item The app must sync with the university calendar
						\item The events manager must be able to update events on the app
						\item Venues must be associated with events going to take place there
 						\item The UP student societies must be able to update their calendars on the app
						\item Log all activities
						\item Log user preferences
					\end{itemize}
				\item Nice To Have
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Fitness track
						\item A brief history about campus building as the user passes them
						\item Reward system if certain milestones archived
						
					\end{itemize}

			\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Performance Requirements}
		\subsubsection{Position Accuracy} The position of a device with NavUP activated should be accurately determined by the system - with no more than 15m of deviation from actual location of the device.
		\subsubsection{Time to Determine Position} It should take NavUP no longer than 45 seconds to determine the location of the device (with reasonable accuracy) once the application has been opened.
		\subsubsection{Immidiacy of Push Notifications} Relevant push notifications should be pushed to the user's device no further than 30m from the focus of said notification. For example, current events at the AULA should not be displayed if a user is further than 30m from the AULA, to prevent cluttering of the notification bar.
		\subsubsection{View/Location Updates} Updates of the user's current location as displayed on the device screen should take place at intervals of no more than 5 seconds.
		\subsubsection{User Login} Upon providing the system with correct credentials, the application must present the user with the navigation screen within 7 seconds. 
	\subsection{Design Constraints}
		\subsubsection{Operating System/Platform} The system must be accessible from both Android and iOS devices - natively.		
	\subsection{Software System Attributes}
		\subsubsection{Reliability} The system should never cease working completely unless the error is caused by external systems outside our control (operating system, web APIs, etc). Decoupling should be such that modules, such as information on landmarks, should still be accessible if navigation fails. Ideally an entire system uptime (per month) of 99.9\% must be reached.
		\subsubsection{Maintainability} The system's code must be well documented, both by means of in-code comments and external documentation, to aid in maintaining the system.
		\subsubsection{Security \& Privacy} NavUP will allow user profiles to be created and personal information to be stored, no unauthorized users should have access to another user's information. Only administrators or the owner of the profile in question should have access to a profile's data.
		\subsubsection{Portability} The system must be available on both Android and iOS devices.
		\subsubsection{Scalability} It must be possible to scale the system backend in the event of an increase of users. Scaling must be possible both horizontally or vertically.
		\subsubsection{Response time} Following user interaction, the system may not delay more than 2 seconds before providing the user with feedback.
		\subsubsection{Usability} NavUP's core functions (navigation, news updates, suggestions) must be easy to understand and use. They must not take the average user more than a minute, each, to access and understand.
